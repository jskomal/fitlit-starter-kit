# Get Fit Get Lit!

### Overview

Get Fit Get Lit is an interactive webpage that tracks a user's wellness data and presents it on a dashboard. Our goal is to present a useful dashboard for a user to view and see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones. 

This app is built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and utilizes TDD with Mocha and Chai.

- The user can select a date that will display their water intake for the day and over the course of the last week
- The user can also see their sleep time and sleep quality and compare against the rest of the week
- Lastly, the user can see their daily steps and where they stand with the average compared to users
